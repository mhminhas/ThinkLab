Build a complete SaaS web platform called "ThinkLab" that allows users to create, manage, and collaborate on AI-powered projects.  
The platform should be production-ready, exportable as a full package (frontend + backend + database) so I can download and host it on my cPanel.  
It must include:

1. **Core Features:**
   - AI-powered tools & templates for content creation, image generation, text summarization, code generation, SEO optimization, data analysis, and more.
   - AI project marketplace where users can browse, purchase, or share templates and tools.
   - Project management dashboard with Kanban board, task lists, file storage, and progress tracking.
   - Real-time collaboration for team members in the "Team" package or higher.
   - Integrated API key management so I can plug in my own AI APIs later.

2. **Security & Authentication:**
   - Email verification on sign-up.
   - Phone number verification via OTP.
   - Optional 2FA using authenticator apps or SMS.
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, User).
   - GDPR-compliant user data handling.

3. **Subscription & Payments:**
   - Plans:
       - Free Trial: 10 credits (no credit card required).
       - Starter: $5/month.
       - Pro: $15/month.
       - Team: $25/month per user (multi-user collaboration tools enabled).
       - Enterprise: "Contact Sales".
   - Monthly and yearly billing options.
   - Stripe and PayPal integration for payments.
   - Automatic credit renewal for subscription plans.
   - Admin panel to manage plans, users, and credits.

4. **Technical Requirements:**
   - Frontend: React.js (Next.js preferred), responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
   - Backend: Node.js with Express.
   - Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
   - API integration structure ready for OpenAI, Stability AI, or other AI APIs.
   - Cloud file storage setup (AWS S3 or similar).
   - Email sending via SMTP or SendGrid.
   - SMS verification using Twilio or similar.
   - Secure environment variables management.
   - Deployment-ready with `.zip` export option for cPanel hosting.

5. **Admin Features:**
   - Dashboard with analytics (active users, revenue, credits usage).
   - User management (suspend, delete, reset password).
   - Payment logs & subscription history.
   - Template & marketplace management.

6. **Other Functional Requirements:**
   - Credit-based AI tool usage for Free Trial users.
   - Dark mode toggle.
   - Notifications via email & in-app alerts.
   - Search & filter for projects and marketplace items.
   - Multi-language support (English default, easy to add others).
   - API documentation page for developers.

Deliver the complete code in a single downloadable package with:
- Installation instructions (`README.md`).
- All required dependencies and `.env.example` file.
- Database migration scripts.
- Ready-to-run build for deployment on my hosting.

The final project should be well-structured, secure, optimized for performance, and easy for me to maintain and scale in the future.
